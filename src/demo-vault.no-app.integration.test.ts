// Launching Obsidian: it reflects the real config from source and asserts every
// Setting is documented in a note, and that the guard note/member still exist
// (rename drift). Sample Plugin Extended's runtime features (commands, ribbon,
// Status bar, modals, editor extensions, and views) are demonstrated in the notes;
// Only the PluginSettings config class is reflected here.
